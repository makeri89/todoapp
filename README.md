# Todoapp

This is a simple todo app built with Next.js and MongoDB.

The UI is built with Radix UI primitives and styled using Stitches together with Radix Colors and Radix Icons.

I built this app because I couldn't find a good and simple app for my needs to make weekly todo lists.

In the app you can create personal todos that you can schedule for this week and the next week or put them in the backlog.
